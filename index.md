## Introduction

Welcome to my personal knowledge archive, a place where I store and share everything I’ve learned over the years. This site serves as a central hub for all the valuable information I've discovered online and in life. Instead of hunting for references scattered across the web, I’ve gathered and reworded them here for quick and easy access.

You can explore my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.navigation.navigations[1].url }}) to dive into the complete collection of posts or browse the [tags]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.navigation.navigations[2].url }}) to see topics organized by category. If you’d like to know more about me, feel free to visit the [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.navigation.navigations[3].url }}).
