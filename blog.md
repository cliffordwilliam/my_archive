## Blog posts

To explore each post, click the **Continue reading** button below the preview. Since pagination isn't available on GitHub Pages, instead you can quickly find specific posts by using `ctrl + f` to search for keywords. Alternatively, visit the [blog page]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.navigation.navigations[1].url }}) to see all posts from newest to oldest.
