## Motivation

I’ve always found it essential to organize and preserve the knowledge I accumulate. With GitHub's reliability—used by major services worldwide—I’ve chosen to use GitHub as my personal lifelong information storage. Writing things down helps me remember, but physical notebooks can pile up quickly, making it difficult to find specific information when needed.

GitHub Pages, combined with Jekyll, provides the perfect solution. It allows me to create, read, update, and delete content instantly, all while eliminating the cost of notebooks and pens. I can search through my notes using the browser’s built-in search functionality and rest easy knowing my data is safe on GitHub’s servers, with the option to back it up locally at any time.

## Who Am I

I’m Clifford William, a full-stack web developer from Indonesia. I’m passionate about learning, collecting information, and sharing knowledge. I strive to continuously improve, not only to support myself and my family through freelance work but also to contribute meaningfully to society.

In my free time, I’m working on a passion project—developing a video game that I plan to release in the future. I hope others will enjoy playing it as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it.

Outside of work, I live a simple life, dedicated to learning new things and applying that knowledge. My interests span from programming and languages to history, finance, cars, art, cooking, and more. This site serves as a repository for everything I learn, and I hope it will be useful to others as well.
