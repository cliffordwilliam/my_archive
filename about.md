## Motivation

GitHub server is very unlikey to go down as major services use it. So I leverage GitHub server as a storage for my life long information storage where I write important things for preservation. I forget things often, so I always write things down in notebooks. Same goes for studying, but that results me having loads of filled notebooks and I have a hard time looking for what I want. So GitHub Pages with Jekyll is the perfect solution. I do not have to waste money buying notebooks and writing utensils. I can CRUD freely and instantenously. I can use the browser API to search keywords, and I can have good persistent storage. Where I do not have to fear of this being lost since it lives in GitHub server and I can always download a backup into any local machine.

## Who am I

I am Clifford William, full-stack web developer from Indonesia. I like to study and collect information. I enjoy learning and trying new things in life and I hate forgetting things. I try to earn money after work with free lancing to support myself and my family. I plan on becoming knowledgable and be able to contribute more to society to be a functioning useful member of society. On the sides I enjoy making video games, right now I am working on a big passion project hobby that I will also create contents for it here, I plan to sell it later in hopes that other people will enjoy playing it as much as I enjoy making it.

I life a simple life, I go to work and go home to either learn new things, try said new things, earn more money or work on my passion game project. I like to study on things like programming, languages, history, finances, cars, art, cooking and so much more. I plan on writing them all down here for both myself and others to read.
