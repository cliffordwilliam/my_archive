## Prerequisites

There are no specific prerequisites for this guide, as you don’t need deep technical knowledge to follow along. I will provide references throughout so you can explore additional background information if you wish.

## Introduction

This guide walks you through using GitHub Pages with Jekyll to create a static site. Imagine manually writing [HTML](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-html-and-css#html-and-css) for each page—home page, about page, product pages, posts, etc. It would be tedious to update the footer or navigation bar on every page manually, especially as your site grows. 

With GitHub Pages and Jekyll, you only need to define the layout and navigation structure once. When you update the navigation bar or footer, the changes are automatically applied across all pages. Jekyll allows you to focus on creating content without the repetitive task of updating page elements, making your project more maintainable.

You can use this setup for various purposes, such as:
- A blog or site for storing posts.
- A gallery or portfolio for images.
- A site for notes, products, or services.

Jekyll lets you create and manage a static site where pages and collections are organized without manual link management. Filtering features can be set up to list posts by tags or other criteria.

In essence, Jekyll helps you manage a large collection of HTML pages, ensuring that inter-page links and navigation are well-organized without manual updates.

## GitHub Pages Setup

Now that you understand the benefits of Jekyll, let’s go through the setup process. All steps and actions are based on the official documentation from GitHub and Jekyll, ensuring that you build your site as intended.

First, read the [GitHub Docs on setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
